## Introduction

I chose to replicate Yu & Smith’s (2007) study on cross-situational word learning because it offers a unique perspective on how humans process ambiguous information in learning environments—a key concept in both cognitive science and AI. I am particularly interested in how the principles of statistical learning observed in human behavior can inform machine learning models. This study demonstrates how learners can rapidly acquire word-referent pairs without direct feedback, using statistical correlations across multiple learning trials. Replicating this experiment will allow me to explore these learning strategies further and assess their reliability in real-world-like settings where ambiguity is inherent.

The stimuli will consist of 54 unfamiliar objects paired with 54 pseudowords, divided into sets of 18 word-referent pairs. Pseudowords will be generated to sound like plausible English words but lack meaning, while the objects will be unfamiliar to prevent prior knowledge from influencing learning.

Participants will be presented with multiple trials in three conditions: 2 words with 2 objects, 3 words with 3 objects, and 4 words with 4 objects. In each trial, words and referents are shown simultaneously without clues linking them, requiring participants to learn the correct word-referent pairings by tracking co-occurrences across trials. After the learning phase, participants will take a forced-choice test to identify the correct referents for each word.

The main challenge will be ensuring the ambiguity of each trial while maintaining statistical information across trials, along with controlling the timing and stimuli presentation to match the original study.

The primary challenge lies in replicating the complex design, ensuring that each trial maintains ambiguity while preserving cross-trial statistical regularities that allow participants to learn the correct word-referent pairings. Additionally, ensuring accurate timing and stimuli presentation, consistent with the original study, will be crucial for a valid replication.

## Methods

### Power Analysis


### Planned Sample
The planned sample size is set at 30 participants based on power analysis, with a termination rule allowing for additional recruitment if data exclusions reduce the usable sample below 30. Participants will be recruited from a university student pool. The sampling frame is limited to native English-speaking adults aged 18 to 35, and participants will receive either course credit or monetary compensation. No preselection rules are applied beyond these demographic and language criteria.

### Materials
All materials will follow the original article’s description precisely. As stated in Yu and Smith (2007), “the stimuli were slides containing pictures of uncommon objects (e.g., canister, facial sauna, and rasp) paired with auditorily presented pseudowords.” The pseudowords are computer-generated to maintain phonotactic probability in English. The word-referent pairs, experimental setup, and conditions (2x2, 3x3, and 4x4) will be recreated according to the original specifications, with each pair presented six times across trials.

### Procedure
The procedure will follow Yu and Smith (2007) with minimal modification: “Each trial began with the simultaneous visual presentation of the referents on a computer monitor. The names were then presented auditorily over the computer’s speakers.” As in the original study, no additional cues will be provided to suggest word-object pairings within individual trials, and participants will complete a 4-alternative forced-choice test following each condition.

### Analysis Plan
The analysis plan will replicate the original study’s strategy closely. Data cleaning rules include removing trials with response times exceeding three standard deviations from the participant’s mean or below 200 ms. Data exclusions will follow the criteria set forth in the “Exclusions” section of this protocol. We will calculate the mean accuracy for each participant in each condition and conduct a repeated-measures ANOVA to test for differences across the 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 conditions.

The primary analysis of interest is the repeated-measures ANOVA, testing whether accuracy varies significantly across conditions with different ambiguity levels. Additional exploratory analyses will examine potential learning patterns across trials.

### Differences from Original Study
Our study aims to mirror the original as closely as possible. However, differences may arise from using a different sample frame (our university student pool) and potential minor procedural adjustments due to updated software or lab equipment. Based on the literature, these differences are not expected to substantially impact the effect, as similar cross-situational learning effects have been observed across various participant pools and setups.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
