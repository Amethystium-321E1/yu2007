## Introduction

I chose to replicate Yu & Smith’s (2007) study on cross-situational word learning because it offers a unique perspective on how humans process ambiguous information in learning environments—a key concept in both cognitive science and AI. I am particularly interested in how the principles of statistical learning observed in human behavior can inform machine learning models. This study demonstrates how learners can rapidly acquire word-referent pairs without direct feedback, using statistical correlations across multiple learning trials. Replicating this experiment will allow me to explore these learning strategies further and assess their reliability in real-world-like settings where ambiguity is inherent. 

The stimuli will consist of 54 unfamiliar objects paired with 54 pseudowords, divided into sets of 18 word-referent pairs. Pseudowords will be generated to sound like plausible English words but lack meaning, while the objects will be unfamiliar to prevent prior knowledge from influencing learning.

Participants will be presented with multiple trials in three conditions: 2 words with 2 objects, 3 words with 3 objects, and 4 words with 4 objects. In each trial, words and referents are shown simultaneously without clues linking them, requiring participants to learn the correct word-referent pairings by tracking co-occurrences across trials. After the learning phase, participants will take a forced-choice test to identify the correct referents for each word.

The main challenge will be ensuring the ambiguity of each trial while maintaining statistical information across trials, along with controlling the timing and stimuli presentation to match the original study.

The primary challenge lies in replicating the complex design, ensuring that each trial maintains ambiguity while preserving cross-trial statistical regularities that allow participants to learn the correct word-referent pairings. Additionally, ensuring accurate timing and stimuli presentation, consistent with the original study, will be crucial for a valid replication. 

The original paper can be accessed via [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x), and the replication materials are available in the [repository here](https://github.com/InterFusion-0053/yu2007/). 


## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
